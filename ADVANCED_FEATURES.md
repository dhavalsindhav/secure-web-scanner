# Advanced Features

This document describes the new advanced features added to the Secure Web Scanner.

## AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection

The security scanner now includes an advanced AI-powered vulnerability detection system that leverages natural language processing and machine learning to identify security issues in source code and web applications.

### Key Features
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Fast preliminary scanning using predefined vulnerability patterns
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: In-depth code analysis using AI models trained on security vulnerabilities
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands the context of the code, not just matching patterns
- **Recommended Fixes**: Provides detailed explanations and suggested fixes for each vulnerability
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, and more

### Usage
```bash
secure-web-scanner ai-scan /path/to/source/code --max-files 10 --output report.html
```

## Enhanced API Security Scanning

The API security scanning module provides comprehensive security assessment for API endpoints and OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

### Key Features
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Analysis**: Parse and analyze API specifications for security issues
- **Active Testing**: Perform security tests against live API endpoints
- **Endpoint Discovery**: Automatically discover API endpoints by crawling websites
- **Authentication Analysis**: Check for proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Detailed Reports**: Get comprehensive reports on API security posture

### Usage
```bash
# Analyze an OpenAPI specification
secure-web-scanner api swagger.yaml --output api-report.html

# Scan a live API
secure-web-scanner api https://api.example.com --active-testing --base-url https://api.example.com
```

## Cloud Security Scanning

The cloud security scanning module helps identify security misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure and configurations.

### Key Features
- **Infrastructure as Code Analysis**: Scan Terraform, CloudFormation and other IaC files
- **Kubernetes Security**: Analyze Kubernetes manifests for security best practices
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Support for AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers
- **Security Best Practices**: Check against cloud security benchmarks and best practices
- **Remediation Guidance**: Get actionable recommendations to fix issues

### Usage
```bash
# Scan cloud configuration files in a directory
secure-web-scanner cloud /path/to/terraform/files --output cloud-report.html

# Scan a specific cloud provider (requires credentials)
secure-web-scanner cloud aws --output aws-report.html
```

## Supply Chain Security

The supply chain security module helps identify vulnerabilities and license issues in project dependencies.

### Key Features
- **Dependency Scanning**: Scan npm, Python, and other package dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **License Compliance**: Check for license issues in dependencies
- **Outdated Package Detection**: Identify outdated packages
- **Security Advisories**: Cross-reference with known security advisories
- **Dependency Graph**: Analyze the full dependency tree

### Usage
```bash
secure-web-scanner deps /path/to/project --output deps-report.html
```

## Enhanced Reporting

The enhanced reporting module provides interactive dashboards and detailed reports in multiple formats.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Report Formats**: Generate reports in JSON, HTML, and PDF formats
- **Interactive Dashboard**: View results in a real-time interactive dashboard
- **Custom Filtering**: Filter and search through scan results
- **Trend Analysis**: Compare results over time
- **Export Options**: Export data for further analysis

### Usage
```bash
# Generate reports from scan results
secure-web-scanner report scan-results.json -f html -o report.html

# Start an interactive dashboard
secure-web-scanner report scan-results.json --interactive --port 3000
```

## Authentication Security Analysis

The authentication security module helps identify vulnerabilities in login mechanisms.

### Key Features
- **Login Form Analysis**: Check login forms for security best practices
- **CSRF Protection**: Verify CSRF token implementation
- **Password Policy**: Check password strength requirements
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Detect if MFA is available
- **JWT Analysis**: Analyze JWT tokens for security issues

### Usage
```bash
secure-web-scanner auth https://example.com/login --output auth-report.html
```
